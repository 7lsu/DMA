# Frequently Asked DMA Questions

__which DMA card should I get?__
: If you want to save money, 35T. If you don't mind spending more for a faster and new DMA card, I suggest the 75T.

__What Firmware do I need for my DMA card?__
: 35T - Squirrel,  75T - EnigmaX1.

__If I have a 35T, and I buy a new card E.g(cap DMA 4th Gen), is it fine to flash the same FW?__
: Yes, both 35T and 4th gen cap DMA share the same prototype chip (squirrel).

__What are the minimum specs I need for my second computer?__
: USB 3.0, at least 6GB RAM, 

__Why do I get Tiny PCIe TLP Algorithm when running a speed test?__
: This happens due to the motherboard in the main PC not liking the config space of the DMA FW.

__How do I flash my FW?__
: If you are using 35T, use Open OCD to [program](https://docs.lambdaconcept.com/screamer/programming.html) and [to upgrade](https://docs.lambdaconcept.com/screamer/openocd.html) or visit [How to Flash](https://github.com/Rakeshmonkee/DMA/tree/main/How%20to%20Flash)
