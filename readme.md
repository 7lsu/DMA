### Custom Direct Memory Access (DMA) Firmware Guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repo is a work in progress. Some stuff might change over time


> [!TIP]
> If you are new to Custom DMA Firmware creation, I leave you with this guide on how to create a basic [DMA CFW](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide) which can be used as a starting point. Once you have a moderate understanding of DMA Firmware, you can go ahead and continue with this guide.

------------------------
You are probably wondering why I made this repo, and quite frankly, it's because CFW sellers scamming and overpricing their FW that at most probably change a few IDs and say its a full 1:1 emu

Charging $200+ for a CFW is insane when you can do the same thing yourself with 1hr minimum of work

Thanks Ekknod for this wonderful masterpiece:
