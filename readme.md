# Direct Memory Access (DMA)

#### DMA or Direct Memory Access is the practice of using an FPGA hardware controller to access the target computer bus master to complete attack operations through memory read and write on a process using a second computer (radar computer.

#### This repo is intended to help with the creation of customised firmware for the DMA controller

> [!TIP]
> If you are new to Custom DMA Firmware creation, I leave you with this guide on how to create a basic [DMA CFW](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide) which can be used as a starting point. Once you have a moderate understanding of DMA Firmware, you may continue with this guide.
