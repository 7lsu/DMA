### Custom Direct Memory Access (DMA) Firmware Guide

With the current state of the DMA custom Firmware Market, prices have been F*cked.

Everyone Gate Keeps their methods and techniques which is why the prices are so high

So,

My goal with creating this repo is to f*ck with CFW sellers until the market is not $2000+ for a FACEIT/VGK firmware or even $150+ for EAC/BE


> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repo is a work in progress. Stuff will change over time


> [!TIP]
> If you are new to Custom DMA Firmware creation, I leave you with this guide on how to create a basic [DMA CFW](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide) which can be used as a starting point. Once you have a moderate understanding of DMA Firmware, you can go ahead and continue with this guide.
