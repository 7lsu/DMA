### Custom Direct Memory Access (DMA) Firmware Guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> No longer updating this repo frequently.
> 
> This guide is not a spoon feed. I have purposely left out some information. It is your job to learn how to make FW while learning something.


> [!TIP]
> If you are new to Custom DMA Firmware creation, I leave you with this guide on how to create a basic [DMA CFW](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide) which can be used as a starting point. Once you have a little more understanding of DMA Firmware, you can go ahead and continue with this guide.
