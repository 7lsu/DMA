> [!TIP]
> If you are new to Custom DMA Firmware creation, I leave you with this guide on how to create a basic [DMA CFW](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide) which can be used as a starting point. Once you have a moderate understanding of DMA Firmware, you can go ahead and continue with this guide.
