# Creation of VGK Firmware

#### Before starting this, I want to thank my friend Movinggun for initially showing me this method/technique on how to bypass VGK ðŸ’–. I was going to release this earlier but I wanted a go from him.

This section will be quick and easy as there aren't many things to change

1. set `HEADER_TYPE` to 80,
2. set `CAPABILITIES_PTR` to 80

By changing just these 2 values to 80 within the config space, you will break the config space and allow us to bypass VGK. If you do a speed test, tiny pcie tlp algo might be selected, this is for you to fix. Go NULL some stuff out in the config space till tiny pcie tlp algo goes away. I suggest you expand on this more, don't just change some values and Header_Type and Cap_Ptr. For this to last a while you need more changes within the config space.

Now you can save $200+ just by changing 2 lines

# Creation of ACE Firmware

Ace, I will release soon when I feel like it
