# Creation of EAC/BE Firmware

The customisations that will be done to bypass EAC/BE at a basic level will be in the [FW Customisations list for EAC/VBE](https://github.com/Rakeshmonkee/DMA/blob/main/EAC-BE%20FW%20Creation/EAC-BE%20FW%20Customisations). You might have also seen this list in the [Possible Vivado Customisations](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide/blob/main/Possible%20Vivado%20Customisations.md) list in made in the [DMA-CFW-Guide](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide/tree/main) which I contribute to. 

To bypass EAC/BE at a moderate level you should change a few more values around within the config space and implement Bar Emulation to successfully load the driver of the device you are trying to mimic which can be found [here](https://github.com/Rakeshmonkee/DMA/tree/main/Bar%20Emulation). otherwise, you will most likely see a yellow icon next to the device in Device Manager.

For a high-level bypass, use [TLP Emulation](https://github.com/Rakeshmonkee/DMA/tree/main/TLP%20Emulation)

You can be assured after you follow the basic steps, you will last a while on any EAC/BE game considering you don't rage cheat and be blatant about cheating. I personally have done the basic step as a test and have lasted over 1 month, no EAC ban but I did receive 1 temp ban for 7 days during the process which was most likely done manually by the server admin because I got too many reports. I got this temp ban because I was too blatant. The game will not be mentioned, but it does use EAC. All I can suggest is, don't be blatant about cheating
